## About The Project

As a developer I need a quick and simple way to give an overview on my skills. Therefore this Portfolio uses the GitHub api, to automatically update  projects I want to show, and summarizes all my lines of code. All my repositories that are linked to a wesbite are included. Different api calls fetch the project image, description, topics and the readme file and display render it. This way whenever I want to add or remove a project to my portfolio, I only need to update the project's repository in my github dashboard, rather than changing my the portfolio's source code itself. 

Because nextjs fetches the api data on build time, I need to commit a new change to the portfolio, to re-build the project and render the new changes.
